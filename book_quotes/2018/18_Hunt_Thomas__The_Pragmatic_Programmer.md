## Hunt_Thomas - The Pragmatic Programmer

We want to see pride of ownership.
"I wrote this, and I stand behind my work."
Your signature should come to be recognized as an indicator of quality.
People should see your name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well written, tested, and documented.
A really professional job.
Written by a professional.

A Pragmatic Programmer.
