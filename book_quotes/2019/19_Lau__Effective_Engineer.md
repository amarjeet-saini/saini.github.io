## Lau - Effective Engineer

Does this perspective mean that we should be pursuing only high-leverage activities?
No that would be exhausting.
We enjoy plenty of leisure activities like traveling, hiking, salsa dancing, and spending time with family and friends without gibing any thought to whether they're high-impact or represent the optimal use of our time - and that's how it should be.
But when it comes to achieving our work and life goals. leverage is a powerful framework for helping us focus on the right things.
