## Dunthorne - Submarine

Old people only say that life happens quickly to make themselves feel better.
The truth is that it all happens in tiny increments like now now now now now now and it only takes twenty to thirty consecutive nows to realize that you're aimed straight at a bench in Singleton Park.
Fair play though, if I was old and had forgotten to do something worthwhile with my life, I would spend those final few years on a bench in the botanical gardens, convincing myself that time is so quick that even plants - who have no responsibilities whatsoever - hardly get a chance to do anything decent with their lives except, perhaps, produce one or two red or yellow flowers and, with a bit of luck and insects, reproduce.
If the old man manages to get the words father and husband on his bench plaque then he thinks he can be reasonably proud of himself.
