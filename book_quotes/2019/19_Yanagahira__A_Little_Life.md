## Yanagahira - A Little Life

He had played the husband, and while he had long ago realized that it had been, really, an awful play (it had included lines like “This isn’t Tosca, you know! This is life!”), he had never forgotten the final monologue he had delivered in the second act, when the wife announces that she wants to leave, that she doesn’t feel fulfilled in their marriage, that she’s convinced that someone better awaits her:

SETH: But don’t you understand, Amy?
You’re wrong.
Relationships never provide you with everything.
They provide you with some things.
You take all the things you want from a person—sexual chemistry, let’s say, or good conversation, or financial support, or intellectual compatibility, or niceness, or loyalty—and you get to pick three of those things.
Three—that’s it.
Maybe four, if you’re very lucky.
The rest you have to look for elsewhere.
It’s only in the movies that you find someone who gives you all of those things.
But this isn’t the movies.
In the real world, you have to identify which three qualities you want to spend the rest of your life with, and then you look for those qualities in another person.
That’s real life.
Don’t you see it’s a trap? If you keep trying to find everything, you’ll wind up with nothing.

AMY: [crying] So what did you pick?

SETH: I don’t know.
[beat] I don’t know.


At the time, he hadn’t believed these words, because at the time, everything really did seem possible: he was twenty-three, and everyone was young and attractive and smart and glamorous.
Everyone thought they would be friends for decades, forever.
But for most people, of course, that hadn’t happened.
As you got older, you realized that the qualities you valued in the people you slept with or dated weren’t necessarily the ones you wanted to live with, or be with, or plod through your days with.
If you were smart, and if you were lucky, you learned this and accepted this.
You figured out what was most important to you and you looked for it, and you learned to be realistic.
They all chose differently: Roman had chosen beauty, sweetness, pliability; Malcolm, he thought, had chosen reliability, and competence (Sophie was intimidatingly efficient), and aesthetic compatibility.
And he? He had chosen friendship.
Conversation.
Kindness.
Intelligence.
When he was in his thirties, he had looked at certain people’s relationships and asked the question that had (and continued to) fuel countless dinner-party conversations: What’s going on there? Now, though, as an almost-forty-eight-year-old, he saw people’s relationships as reflections of their keenest yet most inarticulable desires, their hopes and insecurities taking shape physically, in the form of another person.
Now he looked at couples—in restaurants, on the street, at parties—and wondered: Why are you together? What did you identify as essential to you? What’s missing in you that you want someone else to provide? He now viewed a successful relationship as one in which both people had recognized the best of what the other person had to offer and had chosen to value it as well.
