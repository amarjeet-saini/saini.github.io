## Sandel - Justice

The dearth of attention to inequality in contemporary politics does not reflect any lack of attention to the topic among political philosophers.
The just distribution of income and wealth has been a mainstay of debate within political philosophy from the 1970s to the present.
But the tendency of philosophers to frame the question in terms of utility or consent leads them to overlook the argument against inequality most likely to receive a political hearing and most central to the project of moral and civic renewal.

Some philosophers who would tax the rich to help the poor argue in the name of utility; taking a hundred dollars from a rich person and giving it to a poor person will diminish the rich person’s happiness only slightly, they speculate, but greatly increase the happiness of the poor person.
John Rawls also defends redistribution, but on the grounds of hypothetical consent.
He argues that if we imagined a hypothetical social contract in an original position of equality, everyone would agree to a principle that would support some form of redistribution.

But there is a third, more important reason to worry about the growing inequality of American life: Too great a gap between rich and poor undermines the solidarity that democratic citizenship requires.
Here’s how: As inequality deepens, rich and poor live increasingly separate lives.
The affluent send their children to private schools (or to public schools in wealthy suburbs), leaving urban public schools to the children of families who have no alternative.
A similar trend leads to the secession by the privileged from other public institutions and facilities.
43 Private health clubs replace municipal recreation centers and swimming pools.
Upscale residential communities hire private security guards and rely less on public police protection.
A second or third car removes the need to rely on public transportation.
And so on.
The affluent secede from public places and services, leaving them to those who can’t afford anything else.

This has two bad effects, one fiscal, the other civic.
First, public services deteriorate, as those who no longer use those services become less willing to support them with their taxes.
Second, public institutions such as schools, parks, playgrounds, and community centers cease to be places where citizens from different walks of life encounter one another.
Institutions that once gathered people together and served as informal schools of civic virtue become few and far between.
The hollowing out of the public realm makes it difficult to cultivate the solidarity and sense of community on which democratic citizenship depends.

So, quite apart from its effects on utility or consent, inequality can be corrosive to civic virtue.
Conservatives enamored of markets and liberals concerned with redistribution overlook this loss.

If the erosion of the public realm is the problem, what is the solution?
A politics of the common good would take as one of its primary goals the reconstruction of the infrastructure of civic life.
Rather than focus on redistribution for the sake of broadening access to private consumption, it would tax the affluent to rebuild public institutions and services so that rich and poor alike would want to take advantage of them.

An earlier generation made a massive investment in the federal highway program, which gave Americans unprecedented individual mobility and freedom, but also contributed to the reliance on the private automobile, suburban sprawl, environmental degradation, and living patterns corrosive to community.
This generation could commit itself to an equally consequential investment in an infrastructure for civic renewal: public schools to which rich and poor alike would want to send their children; public transportation systems reliable enough to attract upscale commuters; and public health clinics, playgrounds, parks, recreation centers, libraries, and museums that would, ideally at least, draw people out of their gated communities and into the common spaces of a shared democratic citizenship.

Focusing on the civic consequences of inequality, and ways of reversing them, might find political traction that arguments about income distribution as such do not.
It would also help highlight the connection between distributive justice and the common good.
