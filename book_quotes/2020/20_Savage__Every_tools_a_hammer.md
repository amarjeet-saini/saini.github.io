## Savage - Every tools a hammer

There are few pleasures I now enjoy more than walking into and working out of a cleanshop.
It’s the rare day I leave the shop in a state that’s less than perfectly clean.
And yet, it still happens.
I still run into days where the build was brutal, and I can’t stand to be there one more minute.
Sometimes I still need to bolt, to put an end to a crappy day and just unplug.
On those days, I don’t beat myself up about it.
I try to face myself, but I’m also trying to be gentle in the process.
Present me has a quiet conversation with future me and promises that this isn’t going to become a habit.
The next day, a recharged future me usually responds that it’s okay from time to time to abandon your best-laid plans and just get out.
It’s okay for you, too.
In the world of making, there’s space for that.
There’s space for all.
