## Hitchens - Letters to a Young Contrarian

Don’t let yourself forget it, but try and profit also from the hard experience of those who contested the old conditions and, in a word or phrase, don’t allow your thinking to be done for you by any party or faction, however high-minded.
Distrust any speaker who talks confidently about “we,” or speaks in the name of “us.”
Distrust yourself if you hear these tones creeping into your own style.
The search for security and majority is not always the same as solidarity; it can be another name for consensus and tyranny and tribalism.
Never forget that, even if there are “masses” to be invoked, or “the people” to be praised, they and it must by definition be composed of individuals.
Stay on good terms with your inner Yossarian.
