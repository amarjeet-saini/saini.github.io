For some, I realize, business is the all-out pursuit of profits, period, full stop, but for us business was no more about making money than being human is about making blood.
Yes, the human body needs blood.
It needs to manufacture red and white cells and platelets and redistribute them evenly, smoothly, to all the right places, on time, or else.
But that day-to-day business of the human body isn’t our mission as human beings.
It’s a basic process that enables our higher aims, and life always strives to transcend the basic processes of living—and at some point in the late 1970s, I did, too.
I redefined winning, expanded it beyond my original definition of not losing, of merely staying alive.
That was no longer enough to sustain me, or my company.
We wanted, as all great businesses do, to create, to contribute, and we dared to say so aloud.
When you make something, when you improve something, when you deliver something, when you add some new thing or service to the lives of strangers, making them happier, or healthier, or safer, or better, and when you do it all crisply and efficiently, smartly, the way everything should be done but so seldom is—you’re participating more fully in the whole grand human drama.
More than simply alive, you’re helping others to live more fully, and if that’s business, all right, call me a businessman.

Maybe it will grow on me.
