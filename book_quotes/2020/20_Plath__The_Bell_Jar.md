## Plath - The Bell Jar

I looked at him secretly from under a fall of hair.
He was lying on his back, his hands under his head, staring at the ceiling.
The starched white sleeves of his shirt, rolled up to the elbows, glimmered eerily in the half-dark and his tan skin seemed almost black.
I thought he must be the most beautiful man I’d ever seen.
I thought if only I had a keen, shapely bone-structure to my face or could discuss politics shrewdly or was a famous writer Constantin might find me interesting enough to sleep with.
And then I wondered if as soon as he came to like me he would sink into ordinariness, and if as soon as he came to love me I would find fault after fault, the way I did with Buddy Willard and the boys before him.
The same thing happened over and over:
I would catch sight of some flawless man off in the distance, but as soon as he moved closer I immediately saw he wouldn’t do at all.
That’s one of the reasons I never wanted to get married.
The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from.
I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the coloured arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.
