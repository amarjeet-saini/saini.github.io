* Plotinus

## Saint Augustine
* Son of Saint Monica - still remained skeptical towards Christianity
* "Confessions" - autobiography - regrets of livng a sinful life
* Bad things happen because we are granted free will

> As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him to "take up and read" (Latin: tolle, lege), which he took as a divine command to open the Bible and read the first thing he saw. (Romans chapter 13, verses 13 and 14)

* Similar concept as Descartes

## Three islamic truths

### Al Kindi
* We kind arrive to all truth through reason only, we must add divine wisdom
* He wanted to make Greek though accessible to Muslim audience

`We ought not to be ashamed of appreciating the truth and of acquiring it wherever it comes from even if it comes from races distant and nations different from us. for the seeker of truth, nothing takes precedence over the truth. the status of no one is diminished by the truth, rather does the truth ennoble all.`

### Al Ghazali
* Reason is incapable to encompass all the truth
`What a difference between knowing the definition of health together with its causes, and being healthy.`

### Averroes
* Philosohpy and religion - neither is better just specialized in different areas
* Religion provides an easily digestible version of the truth - masses aren't capable of understanding philosophy

`...the religions are, according to the philosophers, obligatory, since they lead towards wisdom in a way universal to all human beings, philosophy only leads a certain number of people to the knowledge of intellectual happiness...`

## Two mediaval approaches to God

### St. Anselm
* [Ontological proof of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Anselm) (onthology - philosophical study of being)

### Moses Maimonides
* Bible is collection of metaphors 
* God doesn't have human qualities
* We can only describe God by what he isn't (e.g. He's not merciless')

## St. Thomas Aquinas
* Tried to merge Aristotle with Christianity
* Prime mover - everything is moved by another thing - there must have been a thing which wasn't moved by anything

## Blast of the Renaissance
* Black death - killed 30-60% of population - people began to question foundation of society - started to study Greek philosophers

`I have turned my entire attention to Greek. The first thing I shall do, as soon as the money arrives, is to buy some Greek authors; after that, I shall buy clothes.` - Desiderius Erasmus

### Desiderius Erasmus
* People should stop worry about rituals and just love each other

`What hate required these things at your hands? In vain will they make their idle pleas, one that he has lived only on fish, another that he has never changed his sacred hood; this one that he has lost his voice by continual singing of holy anthems, and one that he has forgotten how to speak in his strict obedience to the vow of silence. Our Savior will interrupt their excuses and say: ‘Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, I know you not. I left you but one precept, of loving one another, and that I do not hear any one plead he has faithfully discharged.` 

## Machiavelli

* Most his contributions are in politics
* Great ruler should achieve to achieve stability of his realm at all costs

`"Is it better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved? It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both: but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved."`
