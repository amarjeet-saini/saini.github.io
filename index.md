# Welcome!

Hi! I'm Jakub. 

I like to do bunch of stuff. I like programming, reading books, eating sweets, getting up early (but not by much!).

Even more, I like to work on stuff that other people might find useful. Be it a open-source script, useful website, or notes from a book.

This website is sort of a crossroad between my various endeavours. I invite you to take a tour. It's up to you to pick your turns and decide how long to stay. If you like the destination or if you think it could be improved - please, let me know.

I hope you enjoy your stay.
