## Acemoglu - Why Nations Fail

The solution to the economic and political failure of nations today is to transform their extractive institutions toward inclusive ones.
The vicious circle means that this is not easy.
But it is not impossible, and the iron law of oligarchy is not inevitable.
Either some preexisting inclusive elements in institutions, or the presence of broad coalitions leading the fight against the existing regime, or just the contingent nature of history, can break vicious circles.
