## Dostoevsky - Crime and Punishment

“Why does my action strike them as so horrible?” he said to himself.
“Is it because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at rest.
Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed.
Well, punish me for the letter of the law ... and that’s enough.
Of course, in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps
But those men succeeded and so they were right, and I didn’t, and so I had no right to have taken that step.”
