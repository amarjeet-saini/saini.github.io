## Doerr - All the light we cannot see

Werner thinks about the men in the sunflowers and a hundred others: each lay dead in his hut or truck or bunker, wearing the look of someone who had caught the tune of a familiar song.
A crease between the eyes, a slackness to the mouth.
A look that said: So soon? But doesnâ€™t it play for everybody too soon?
