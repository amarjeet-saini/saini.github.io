## Schroeder - The Snowball

Stocks are the things to own over time.
Productivity will increase and stocks will increase with it.
There are only a few things you can do wrong.
One is to buy or sell at the wrong time.
Paying high fees is the other way to get killed.
The best way to avoid both of these is to buy a low-cost index fund, and buy it over time.
Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy, but donâ€™t think you can outsmart the market.
