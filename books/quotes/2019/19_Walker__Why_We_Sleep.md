## Walker - Why We Sleep

Within the space of a mere hundred years, human beings have abandoned their biologically mandated need for adequate sleep - one that evolution spent 3,400,000 years perfecting in service to life-support functions.
As a result, the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our life expectancy, our safety, our productivity, and the education of our children.
 This silent sleep loss epidemic is the greatest public health challenge we face in the twenty-first century in developed nations.
If we wish to avoid the suffocating noose of sleep neglect, the premature death it inflicts, and the sickening health it invites, a radical shift in our personal, cultural, professional, and societal appreciation of sleep must occur.
 I believe it is time for us to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep, without embarrassment or the damaging stigma of laziness.
In doing so, we can be reunited with that most powerful elixir of wellness and vitality, dispensed through every conceivable biological pathway.
Then we may remember what it feels like to be truly awake during the day, infused with the very deepest plentitude of being.
