## Overview
#### a) BFS
From 0 nodes.
Distance of node is one more than the distance of node from which it was discovered.
Use -1 to mark unprocessed nodes. Checking if node equals 1 isn't sufficient, because that may already be it's distance.

#### b) Dynamic programming
Another way to solve this is to iterate over the grid and update distances.
To do it, we know that `distance` of current node is minimum of distances of all its neighbours + 1 (If the node isn't zero).

However, when we arrive at the node, we haven't yet find the min. dist of right and down node.

The solution is to do two iterations:

1. If we start at the beginning, we know left and up neighbour will be finished by the time we arrive at the node. So compare it to those two.
2. If we iterate backwards, we can use down and right neighbour.

## Code
a)
```python
from collections import deque

NOT_PROCESSED = -1


class Solution:
    def inBounds(self, x: int, y: int, array: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        return 0 <= x < len(array) and 0 <= y < len(array[x])

    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        queue = deque([])

        for x in range(len(mat)):
            for y in range(len(mat[0])):
                if mat[x][y] == 0:
                    queue.append((x, y, 0))
                else:
                    mat[x][y] = NOT_PROCESSED

        while len(queue) > 0:
            x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
            for n_x, n_y in [(x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)]:
                if self.inBounds(n_x, n_y, mat) and mat[n_x][n_y] == NOT_PROCESSED:
                    mat[n_x][n_y] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((n_x, n_y, dist + 1))

        return mat
```

b)
```python
class Solution:
    def inBounds(self, x: int, y: int, array: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        return 0 <= x < len(array) and 0 <= y < len(array[x])

    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        for x in range(len(mat)):
            for y in range(len(mat[0])):
                if mat[x][y] == 0:
                    continue
                a = mat[x - 1][y] if self.inBounds(x - 1, y, mat) else inf
                b = mat[x][y - 1] if self.inBounds(x, y - 1, mat) else inf
                mat[x][y] = min(a, b) + 1
        for x in range(len(mat) - 1, -1, -1):
            for y in range(len(mat[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
                a = mat[x + 1][y] if self.inBounds(x + 1, y, mat) else inf
                b = mat[x][y + 1] if self.inBounds(x, y + 1, mat) else inf
                mat[x][y] = min(a + 1, b + 1, mat[x][y])
        return mat
```

> inBounds check can be simplified and put outside the method. We're always checking the overflow only in one direction.
> len(mat), len(mat[0]) could be saved to variables.

## Notes
Both approaches have O(M * N) complexity, but `b)` is O(1) in space, not needing the queue.
DP method even when it at first glance didn't look like it can be used. 
> (Well, it didn't look like it for more glances. Until I glanced at the solution. )
