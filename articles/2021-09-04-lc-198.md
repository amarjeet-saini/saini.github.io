<https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/>

## Overview
On each house two choices:
* Rob it. But then it's impossible to rob next, so move by 2 houses.
* Don't rob current house, move by one house.

Memoization.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def robWithMemory(nums: List[int], start: int, memory: Dict[int, int]) -> int:
            if start >= len(nums):
                return 0
            if start in memory:
                return memory[start]

            result = max(nums[start] + robWithMemory(nums, start + 2, memory),
                         robWithMemory(nums, start + 1, memory))
            memory[start] = result
            return result

        memory = {}
        return robWithMemory(nums, 0, memory)
```
