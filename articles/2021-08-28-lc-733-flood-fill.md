# 733. Flood Fill

<https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/>

## Overview
DFS.
It's not necessary to remember visited nodes because this information is implicit in the colors, which are being changed (if needed) on visits.

Edge case: new color is same as old - then it's obvious no changes will be made. If we didn't check this condition, algorithm might not finish, because it can't distinguish visited notes.

## Code
```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def inBounds(self, x: int, y: int, array: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        return 0 <= x < len(array) and 0 <= y < len(array[x])

    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, new_color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        new_image = deepcopy(image)
        old_color = image[sr][sc]
        if old_color == new_color:
            return new_image
        self.floodFillInPlace(new_image, sr, sc, new_color, old_color)
        return new_image

    def floodFillInPlace(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, new_color: int, old_color: int) -> None:
        if not self.inBounds(sr, sc, image) or image[sr][sc] != old_color:
            return
        image[sr][sc] = new_color
        neighbours = [(sr + 1, sc), (sr - 1, sc), (sr, sc + 1), (sr, sc - 1)]
        for x, y in neighbours:
            self.floodFillInPlace(image, x, y, new_color, old_color)
```
