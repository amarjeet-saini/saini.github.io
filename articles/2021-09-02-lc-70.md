## Overview
Fibonacci sequence. Use memoization to avoid calculating same things repeatedly.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        def climbStairsWithMemory(n: int, memory: Dict[int, int]) -> int:
            if n in memory:
                return memory[n]
            result = climbStairsWithMemory(n - 1, memory) + climbStairsWithMemory(n - 2, memory)
            memory[n] = result
            return result

        memo = {1: 1, 2: 2}
        return climbStairsWithMemory(n, memo)
```

Without need for memoization, remembering only two last values, which is enough to calculate the next one.
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a, b = 1, 2
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
```
