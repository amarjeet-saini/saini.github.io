# 120. Triangle
#### Published 4.9.2021

<https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/>

## Overview
If the cell isn't first or last in the row, it can continue in two ways. Go both ways, and pick the smaller one. Add the value of current cell to get the value of the cell.

Remember results to avoid calculating same things multiple times.

Memory complexity: O(n), where n is number of *cells* (for memory).

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        memory: Dict[Tuple[int, int], int] = {}

        def minimumTotalMem(triangle: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int) -> int:
            if row == len(triangle) - 1:
                return triangle[row][col]
            if (row, col) in memory:
                return memory[(row, col)]

            # neighboring in next row: col, col + 1
            a = minimumTotalMem(triangle, row + 1, col)
            b = minimumTotalMem(triangle, row + 1, col + 1)
            result = triangle[row][col] + min(a, b)
            memory[row, col] = result
            return result

        return minimumTotalMem(triangle, 0, 0)
```

### Follow up
O(n) extra space, where n is number of *rows*.

Starting at the bottom row, keep in memory minimal paths for the cells in current row.

1. Copy the bottom row to `minpaths`. Minimal paths for last row are the cells themselves.
2. On second-to-last row, for each cell pick the smaller one from two adjacent `minpaths`. Add it to the cell value. That's the minimal path for the cell. Store it in `minpaths`.
	> On each iteration, length of `minpaths` decreases by one.
3. Repeat for every row.
4. In the only element of `minpaths` is the minimal path starting on the top cell of the triangle.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        last_row = len(triangle) - 1
        current_row_minpaths = triangle[last_row].copy()
        for row_i in range(last_row - 1, -1, -1):
            for col_i in range(len(triangle[row_i])):
                current_row_minpaths[col_i] = triangle[row_i][col_i] + min(current_row_minpaths[col_i],
                                                                           current_row_minpaths[col_i + 1])
        return current_row_minpaths[0]
```
