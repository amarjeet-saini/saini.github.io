<https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/>

## Overview
The idea with these type of backtracking problems is to have an array accessible from inner function, where final results are stored.

To return each combination only once and not its permutation, digits in the number must be in ascending order.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def combine_rec(number: List[int], k: int, index: int) -> None:
            if k == 0:
                combinations.append(number)
                return

            if index + k - 1 >= len(numbers):
                return

            for p in range(index, len(numbers)):
                combine_rec(number + [numbers[p]], k - 1, p + 1)

        combinations = []
        numbers = [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
        combine_rec([], k, 0)
        return combinations
```
